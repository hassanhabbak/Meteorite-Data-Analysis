## Design
I first laid out the Meteorite recordings over the map to have a bird eye view of where they fall and how big they are. The mass size is denoted by the size of the circle on the map. This allows viewers to get a sense of the data right away and also offer great filtering capabilities if needed.

I then focused on bar charts as a way to lay out the amount of mass per year and how the number of Meteorites detected per year changed. This gives viewers an idea on how data detection improved over the years and how it corresponds to technological advancement.

In the end I show the years with biggest Meteorites mass detected. Highlighting the biggest meteorites ever found which weights at 60 tons!

## Feedback
“The visualization is very informative and tells the Meteorites story quite well and in an interesting way.”
